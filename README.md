# webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin

`webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin` is a webpack plugin that generates a PWA manifest and integrates with the assets JSON generated by [assets-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ztoben/assets-webpack-plugin).

# How to install it

```
npm install --save-dev webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin
```

or

```
yarn add webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin --dev
```

# Using it the easy way

Name all of your icon files `manifest/icon_[square dimension].(png|jpeg|jpg)`. If you have a different naming scheme for your files, check out the section [Using it the hard way](#using-it-the-hard-way) below.

In your webpack config file:

```js
import AppManifestPlugin from 'webpack-web-app-manifest-plugin';

...

plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    content: {
      name: 'Tumblr',
      short_name: 'Tumblr',
      background_color: '#36465d',
    },
    destination: '/manifest',
  }),
],

...
```

To access the app manifest file path from your asset manifest:

```jsx
const manifest = // however you usually access your asset manifest in code
const appManifestPath = manifest['app-manifest'].json;

...

<link rel="manifest" href={appManifestPath} />
```

# Using it the hard way

If you don't want to name your icons based on our naming scheme, you will want to implement a few functions that are passed into the plugin.

## `isAssetManifestIcon()`

`isAssetManifestIcon` is a function to determine if a webpack asset should be included as an icon in the web app manifest. The function accepts a `filename` parameter and returns true or false.

For example, if you only wanted to include a specific list of files, you could implement it like this:

```js
plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    ...
    isAssetManifestIcon: (fileName) => ['myIcon1.png', 'myIcon2.png'].indexOf(fileName) >= 0,
  }),
],
```

## `getIconSize()`

`getIconSize` is a function to determine the icon size of any asset that passes the check `isAssetManifestIcon()`. The function accepts a `fileName` parameter and returns an object `{ width, height }`.

For example, if you wanted to hardcode a list of sizes for your icons, you could implement it like this:

```js
const iconSizes = {
  'myIcon1.png': { width: 120, height: 120},
  'myIcon2.png': { width: 80, height: 80},
};

...

plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    ...
    getIconSize: (fileName) => iconSizes[fileName],
  }),
],
```

## `getIconType()`

`getIconType` is a function to determine the type of any asset that passes the check `isAssetManifestIcon()`. The function accepts a `fileName` parameter and returns a string describing the mime type of the asset, ex. "image/png".

For example, if you wanted to hardcode a list of mime types for your icons, you could implement it like this:

```js
const iconTypes = { 'myIcon1.png': 'image/png', 'myIcon2.jpg': 'image/jpeg' };

...

plugins: [
  new AppManifestPlugin({
    ...
    getIconType: (fileName) => iconTypes[fileName],
  }),
],
```
